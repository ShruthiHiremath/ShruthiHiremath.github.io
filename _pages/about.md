I am a (final year-) Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at the Georgia Institute of Technology, advised by Dr. Thomas Ploetz. At Georgia Tech, I am associated with the [Computational Behavior Analysis](https://cba.gatech.edu) and [Ubiquitous Computing Lab](https://ubicomp.cc.gatech.edu). I am on the industry job market and am interested in exploring opportunities that align with my skill set. I look forward to making contributions towards impactful and exciting work.

Research Interest
------
My research interest broadly focuses on building novel activity recognition pipelines for wearable and nearable sensing devices. During the course of my Ph.D. I have focused on developing machine learning algorithms for activity monitoring and behavior analysis.
