Research Statement
======
My dissertation builds pipelines for recognizing activities in smart homes, by observing data collected from residents using nearable sensors. 
As such I propose a **'lifespan of a human activity recognition system in smart homes'**, which includes (a) initial bootstrapping procedure - aimed at `jump-starting' the activity recognition system in the home, with minimal supervision from the resident, without considerable wait times; (b) updating and extending the activity recognition system - aimed at improving the recognition capabilities of the initial bootstrapped system; (c) routine assessment - aimed at behavior monitoring of residents over extended periods of observation. 

Education
======
* Ph.D in Computer Science, Georgia Institute of Technology
* M.S. in Computer Science, Georgia Institute of Technology
* B.Tech. in Computer Science, Vellore Institute of Technology

Work experience
======
* Aug 2018 - Present: Graduate Research Assistant
  * Georgia Institute of Technology
  * I developed data-driven technologies for wearable and nearable based
  application scenarios to build deployable human activity recognition sys-
  tems, with a focus on providing health monitoring.
  * Published at venues: IMWUT, ISWC, Sensors, International Conference on Activity and Behavior Computing
  * Supervisor: Dr. Thomas Ploetz

* Aug 2018 - Present: Graduate Teaching Assistant
  * Georgia Institute of Technology
  * CS 6601: Artificial Intelligence - design assignments and exams
  * CS 7470: Mobile & Ubiquitous Computing - design exams
 
* May - July 2016 : Data Science Intern
  * ADP Solutions
  * My work involved development of data analysis procedures to analyze
  and gather insights from collected payroll data.
  
* Aug 2014 - July 2015: Software Developer
  * Deloitte USI (India)
  * I was involved in building a tool that served as an interface between
  end users and project management activities(PMC) aimed as reducing
  the number of manual tickets raised for changes to a project team. The
  tool successfully contributed to a 70% reduction in costs associated with
  handling tickets, thereby achieving significant cost savings
