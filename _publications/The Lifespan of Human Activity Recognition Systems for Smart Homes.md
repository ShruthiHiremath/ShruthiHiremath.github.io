**Abstract**

With the growing interest in smart home environments and in providing seamless interactions with various smart devices, robust and reliable human activity recognition (HAR) systems are becoming essential. Such systems provide automated assistance to residents or to longitudinally monitor their daily activities for health and well-being assessments, as well as for tracking (long-term) behavior changes. These systems thus contribute towards an understanding of the health and continued well-being of residents. Smart homes are personalized settings where residents engage in everyday activities in their very own idiosyncratic ways. In order to provide a fully functional HAR system that requires minimal supervision, we provide a systematic analysis and a technical definition of the lifespan of activity recognition systems for smart homes. Such a designed lifespan provides for the different phases of building the HAR system, where these different phases are motivated by an application scenario that is typically observed in the home setting. Through the aforementioned phases, we detail the technical solutions that are required to be developed for each phase such that it becomes possible to derive and continuously improve the HAR system through data-driven procedures. The detailed lifespan can be used as a framework for the design of state-of-the-art procedures corresponding to the different phases.
