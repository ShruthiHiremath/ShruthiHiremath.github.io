**Abstract**

Most research on aggression, self-injury, and disruption in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has relied on caregiver report or direct observation, both of which have limitations. Past studies demonstrate preliminary evidence for direct detection of these behaviors using accelerometers, but additional research is needed to determine the feasibility during actual clinical assessments and times when a therapist cannot be present for direct observation, as measurement during these periods has the most applied significance.
This study addressed these gaps by evaluating the feasibility of accelerometer use with children with ASD and severe aggression, self-injury, and disruption in clinical and home contexts.
We evaluated the feasibility of individuals with ASD wearing accelerometers during behavioral assessments following structured habituation procedures. We also evaluated the feasibility of caregivers applying sensors to individuals with ASD in the home setting.
Most participants passed habituation and tolerated sensors during behavioral assessments (e.g., functional analyses). Caregivers applied sensors in the home with variable fidelity with wear time duration and data-collection.
The feasibility of using accelerometers with this population is promising and should be explored further in future research.
